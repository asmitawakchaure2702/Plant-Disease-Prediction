# plant-disease-prediction-cnn-deep-learning-project
PlantGuard is a deep learning web application built with Streamlit and TensorFlow that uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to detect plant diseases from leaf images. The system is trained on the PlantVillage dataset and provides real-time disease classification through an intuitive web interface. Users can upload leaf images via drag-and-drop functionality and receive instant predictions with high accuracy. The application supports multi-class disease detection across various crops. The technology stack includes TensorFlow 2.x for the CNN model, Streamlit for the web interface, and Python for backend processing, making it suitable for agricultural professionals, farmers, and plant enthusiasts seeking rapid disease identification and crop monitoringÂ solutions.
